Statistical Report Objectives and Methods for AI Use and Adoption in IFSC Entities
Objective 1: Assess the Association Between Entity Type and AI Adoption Status

Statistical Test: Chi-Square Test for Independence (or Fisher's Exact Test if expected cell counts <5).  
Rationale: Tests if AI adoption status ("Under consideration," "Implementation in progress," "Not considered") varies significantly by entity type (e.g., Finance Company, Fund Management Entity). Data shows Finance Companies have 30% "Implementation in progress" vs. 20% for Fund Management Entities. Chi-square is ideal for categorical variables; Fisher’s is used for sparse tables. Compute Cramér’s V for effect size.  
Implementation: Use pandas.crosstab to create a contingency table (e.g., entity type vs. adoption status), then scipy.stats.chi2_contingency or scipy.stats.fisher_exact. Report p-value and effect size.


Graphs/Diagrams:  
Clustered Bar Chart: Display adoption status proportions (e.g., 25/60 "Under consideration") across entity types. Each bar represents an entity type, with segments for adoption statuses.  
Why: Highlights differences visually (e.g., Finance Companies’ higher adoption). Use seaborn.catplot or matplotlib.


Heatmap: Show contingency table frequencies with color intensity for counts (e.g., Finance Companies x "Under consideration" = 10).  
Why: Reveals patterns in associations. Use seaborn.heatmap with p-value annotation.




Expected Output: Contingency table, p-value (e.g., p<0.05 indicates significance), Cramér’s V (e.g., 0.2 for moderate effect), and visualizations to recommend targeted policies.

Objective 2: Evaluate Differences in AI Maturity Levels Across Drivers of Adoption

Statistical Test: Multinomial Logistic Regression (or Binary Logistic Regression for simplified "Early-stage" vs. "Operational/Advanced"). Supplement with Z-Test for Proportions for pairwise driver comparisons.  
Rationale: Models whether drivers (e.g., "enhanced operational efficiency," cited by 46.7%) predict maturity levels ("Early-stage," 43.3%; "Operational," 15%). Logistic regression handles multi-select binary predictors (drivers) and categorical outcomes (maturity). Z-tests compare proportions (e.g., efficiency adopters vs. non-adopters on maturity).  
Implementation: Dummy-code drivers in pandas (e.g., 1/0 for "efficiency"), use statsmodels.Logit or sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression. For proportions, use statsmodels.stats.proportion_ztest. Report odds ratios, p-values, and pseudo-R².


Graphs/Diagrams:  
Coefficient Plot: Display odds ratios (e.g., efficiency increases odds of "Operational" by 2.5x) with 95% confidence intervals.  
Why: Shows driver impact clearly. Use matplotlib or seaborn.pointplot.


Stacked Bar Chart: Show maturity level distribution across entities citing each driver (e.g., 70% of efficiency-driven entities are "Early-stage").  
Why: Visualizes driver-maturity relationships. Use matplotlib.pyplot.bar.




Expected Output: Odds ratios (e.g., OR=2.5, p<0.05), proportion differences (e.g., 60% vs. 40%, p<0.05), and visualizations to prioritize drivers for maturity acceleration.

Objective 3: Investigate the Relationship Between Key Challenges and Risks

Statistical Test: Phi Coefficient for binary correlations and McNemar’s Test for paired multi-select items.  
Rationale: Assesses if challenges (e.g., "data privacy," 41.7%) correlate with risks (e.g., "data security breaches," 58.3%). Phi measures binary associations; McNemar’s tests if selecting a challenge implies selecting a related risk (e.g., 65% overlap).  
Implementation: Create binary matrices for challenges/risks in pandas, use scipy.stats.phi or pingouin.phi for correlations, and scipy.stats.mcnemar for paired tests. Report correlation coefficients and p-values.


Graphs/Diagrams:  
Correlation Matrix Heatmap: Display Phi coefficients (e.g., 0.4 for privacy-breaches) with color gradients.  
Why: Visualizes strength of challenge-risk relationships. Use seaborn.heatmap.


Venn Diagram: Show overlap between challenges and risks (e.g., 20 entities cite both "privacy" and "breaches").  
Why: Highlights co-occurrence intuitively. Use matplotlib_venn.




Expected Output: Phi coefficients (e.g., φ=0.4, p<0.05), McNemar’s p-value, and visualizations to suggest bundled governance solutions.

Objective 4: Compare Proportions of AI Trends Exploration by Maturity Level

Statistical Test: Z-Test for Proportions (or Chi-Square Test for multiple trends). Apply Bonferroni Correction for multiple comparisons.  
Rationale: Tests if mature entities (e.g., "Operational," 15%) explore more trends (e.g., "predictive analytics," 33.3%) than "Early-stage" (43.3%). Data shows mature entities average 1.8 trends vs. 1.2 for early-stage. Z-test compares proportions; chi-square handles multi-trend analysis.  
Implementation: Group by maturity in pandas, compute trend proportions (e.g., 50% of "Operational" cite "predictive analytics"), use statsmodels.stats.proportion_ztest or scipy.stats.chi2_contingency. Adjust p-values for multiple tests.


Graphs/Diagrams:  
Bar Chart with Error Bars: Show trend proportions by maturity level with 95% confidence intervals (e.g., "predictive analytics": 50% for "Operational" vs. 30% for "Early-stage").  
Why: Compares adoption clearly. Use seaborn.barplot with ci="sd".


Grouped Bar Chart: Display multiple trends across maturity levels (e.g., "predictive analytics" vs. "LLMs").  
Why: Shows trend preferences. Use matplotlib.pyplot.bar.




Expected Output: Proportion differences (e.g., 20% higher for "Operational," p<0.05 post-correction), and visualizations to guide trend-focused training.

Objective 5: Analyze the Impact of Governance Frameworks on Audit Processes

Statistical Test: Fisher’s Exact Test (due to small counts, e.g., 8/60 "Yes" for audits). Compute Odds Ratio for effect size.  
Rationale: Tests if having governance frameworks (e.g., "data governance," 35%) increases likelihood of established audits (13.3% "Yes," 30% "In Progress"). Data shows frameworks correlate with 2x audit likelihood. Fisher’s is suitable for small 2x2 tables.  
Implementation: Create 2x2 table (frameworks vs. audit: Yes/No) in pandas, use scipy.stats.fisher_exact. Report odds ratio and p-value.


Graphs/Diagrams:  
Mosaic Plot: Visualize framework-audit contingency table (e.g., 80% of audit "Yes" have frameworks).  
Why: Shows proportional relationships clearly. Use statsmodels.graphics.mosaic.


Bar Chart: Compare audit status ("Yes"/"In Progress"/"No") for entities with/without frameworks.  
Why: Highlights governance impact. Use seaborn.catplot.




Expected Output: Odds ratio (e.g., OR=3.0, p<0.05), p-value, and visualizations to advocate IFSCA-mandated frameworks.

Notes for Implementation

Data Cleaning: Handle "Not applicable" as NaN, parse multi-select fields (e.g., drivers) into binary columns using pandas.get_dummies.  
Tools: Use Python (pandas, scipy, statsmodels, seaborn, matplotlib, matplotlib_venn) for computations and visualizations.  
Report Structure: Include tables (contingency, coefficients), visualizations, and p-values with interpretations (e.g., "p<0.05 suggests significant association").  
Impress the Chairman: Emphasize actionable insights (e.g., "Fund Management Entities lag in adoption, suggesting IFSCA training programs") and clear visuals with concise captions.
